# DSnP Final Project 
Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph (FRAIG) 

### Description 
- Using hash to detect structurally equivalent signals in a circuit. 
- Performing Boolean logic simulations and designing your own data structure to identify functionally equivalent candidate pairs in the circuit. 
- Being able to call Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver to prove the functional equivalence.
